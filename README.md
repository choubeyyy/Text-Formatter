# Text-Formatter

Need: While writing any caption in LinkedIn, I had to copy and paste formatted texts from multiple websites which was cumbersome so I decided to make my own :)
My text formatter : 
This text formatter changes the text to either bold or italic which can be copied. This copied text can be used in any textbox for pasting without changing the format of the text. 

I will add other text styles as I move forward and customize this project.
